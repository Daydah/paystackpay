## Installation
- Download the plugin.
- Log into the back end of your Joomla! site.
- On the Control Panel page, click "Install Extensions" > "Upload Package File" OR from the top menu, click Extensions > Manage > Install > Upload Package File.

## Setup
After successful installation, open the plugin by going to Extensions > Plugin, then searching for it.

- Open the PPD component configuration by going to Components > Pay Per Download > Configuration.
- On the "Gateway Settings" tab, set "Use PayPal" to NO, "Use Payment Gateway Plugin" to YES.

### Constraints
- (In version 1.0): Nigerian NGN currency code is not in the PPD component by default. I had to add Currency Code manually to PPD (see how to [here](http://www.ratmilwebsolutions.com/forum/4-payperdownload-support/2545-how-to-add-new-currency.html) ). I had to also add a field for capturing currency code in the payment plugin because of this. I hope I can remove the field in later versions.

## Update
- (In version 1.3.0): added support for taxes, removed duplicate values, fixed wrong return fee, and removed firstname/lastname which could be incorrect (handled by the payment gateway) (By Olivier).

- (In version 1.1): The PayPerDownload plugin version 6.1.0 now factors in a dropdown for you to select your currency. This plugin has been updated to reflect that upgrade (Thanks Olivier and Ratmil!).
